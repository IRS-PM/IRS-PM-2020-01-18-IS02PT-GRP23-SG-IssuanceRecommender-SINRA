### DEFINITION OF INTEGRATED SHIELD PLAN
An Integrated Shield Plan (IP) provides coverage on top of your MediShield Life. Different types of IPs provide different coverage. Some cover you for a higher-type ward (A/B1) in a public hospital, while others cover admission into a private hospital.MediShield Life is the most basic sort of health insurance and covers basic healthcare in public hospitalsâ€™ lower-class wards. However, addition of Integrated Shield Plan (IP) gives you the option to get treated in better class wards and private hospitals, managed by the private insurer.
